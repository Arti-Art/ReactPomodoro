# React-Pomodoro

## Presentation
This is a solo project done during my bootcamp training in web development @ BeCode Li√®ge.

The goal was to discover React by building a pomodoro with basic functionalities: 
a timer, a "+" button to add minutes, a "-" button to substract minutes, a "Start"
button to launch and pause the timer and a "Reset" button to reset the time.

We had one week to complete the project.
